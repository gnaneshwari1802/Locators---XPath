## Installation

To get started with Selenium and XPath, follow these steps:

1. Install Java from the official [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html).
2. Install Selenium WebDriver by adding the dependency to your projectâ€™s `pom.xml` (for Maven users):
   
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
       <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
       <version>3.141.59</version>
   </dependency>
